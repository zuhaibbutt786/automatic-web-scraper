Welcome to the Web Scraping App! This app allows you to extract data from web pages by specifying the URL and selecting HTML classes to scrape. No coding skills required!

#About
Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. This app simplifies the process and lets you scrape data easily. It uses the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML content and provides a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

The app will fetch the available classes from the provided URL and display them as options.

Click the 'Scrape' button to extract the data from the selected classes.
The scraped data will be displayed in a table below.
You can download the scraped data as a CSV file using the 'Download CSV' button.

#Tips for Successful Scraping
Make sure you have proper permissions to scrape data from the website.
Respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.
Be considerate of the website's resources and avoid aggressive scraping.
Test the app with different websites to ensure it works as expected.
Regularly check and update the scraping code, as website structures may change.
